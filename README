A Django app which will allow you to restrict listeners to an icecast2 stream.

You grant access to a mount point by adding an Authorization model instance.
You specify the mount point, a user name, a password, and a start and end time
for the authorization.  When a user connects to a mount point which is
configured to use URL authentication with the sample below, the icecast2 
server will check the user's credentials against the username and password
while also verifying that the current time is within the specified
authorization timeframe.  Additionally, if the user is granted access, the 
Django view will set the timelimit header to the end of the authorization
window for that user.

Note: this stuff only works if the icecast client in use supports
authorization.  VLC does.

<mount>
    <mount-name>/mount_name</mount-name>
    <authentication type="url">
        <option name="listener_add" value="http://your-django.tld/icecast/listener/add/"/>
        <option name="listener_remove" value="http://your-django.tld/icecast/listener/remove/"/>
        <option name="auth_header" value="icecast-auth-user: 1"/>
        <option name="timelimit_header" value="icecast-auth-timelimit:"/>
    </authentication>
</mount>
